# Genetic Algorithm for Permutations:  Parallel CPU Implementation

This repository contains an OpenMP implementation of a genetic algorithm for pattern counting in permutations.

To compile, ensure that OpenMP is installed.  Then, run:

```sh
$ make
```

To run, pass in a configuration file from `config/`:

```sh
$ ./perms configs/basic_1234
```
